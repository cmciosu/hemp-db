This repository hosts all code and documentation for the HempDB Senior Capstone Project, CS46X at Oregon State University

## About

This web application is intended to aid the Oregon State University Center for Marketing and Consumer Insights with performing market research in the hemp industry. This research is supported by **USDA AFRI SAS Grant# 2021-68012-35957**. 

What was previously a single large excel sheet is now a hosted web application, backed by a relational database for easy and robust data storage and modeling. With user experience in mind, this website makes it easy for researchers to manage the large repository of company data, while also allowing them to share their research with the public
